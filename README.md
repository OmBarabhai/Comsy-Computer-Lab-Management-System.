Comsy: The Computer Lab Management System is a comprehensive, web-based application developed to manage and optimize computer lab activities in academic institutions. It facilitates smooth coordination between lab administrators, and students by offering essential features such as lab system booking, automated system monitoring, attendance tracking, and issue reporting. The system is built using modern web technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), Node.js with Express (backend), and MongoDB (database). With integrated security features like bcrypt password hashing and JWT-based session management, Comsy ensures secure and efficient user management.
In addition to offering tailored dashboards for Admin, and Student, roles, Comsy also uses Electron applications to automatically fetch and update system specifications in real-time, while WebSocket integration enables live data updates across dashboards. The platform not only simplifies routine tasks but also improves the efficiency and transparency of lab usage through real-time system visibility, reducing dependency on manual work and minimizing downtime.
